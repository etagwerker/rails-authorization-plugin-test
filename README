== Authorization Test Application

This is a test application (and new application scaffold) for the Authorization
plugin with Object Roles table support. The Authorization plugin is described
in vendors/plugins/authorization/README (or check nicely formatted HTML docs in
that plugin directory /doc).

Prerequisites:
- Ruby on Rails v 2.0.2 or higher
- The Ruby Sqlite3 gem is installed and functional.  You can use MySQL for the tests but will need to manually create the databases needed and add them to 'config/database.yml' yourself.

Running the Tests:
- Make sure you have the correct authorization plugin which gets included as a git sub-module:
  - first time:
    - git submodule init
    - git submodule update
  - to pick up later updates to the plugin sub-module do something like:
    - cd vendor/plugins/authorization
    - git checkout master
    - git remote update
    - cd ../../../
    - rake test

(Note: Learn more about using submodules here : http://woss.name/2008/04/09/using-git-submodules-to-track-vendorrails/ )

- Make sure /config/database.yml has the correct settings for your DB (Default Sqlite3).
- Run the migration using "rake db:migrate" or reset the DB with "rake db:migrate:reset"
- Run 'rake test' from the root of the test application.

Optional manual tests:
- Start an instance of the mongrel webserver by running './script/server'
- Surf to http://localhost:3000 and try out the sample application.

Things to look at:
* The integration tests in /test/integration. Enter "rake test:integration" to run them.
* The migration scripts in /db/migrate.
* Notice how you can mix hardwired roles in your code with database roles.
