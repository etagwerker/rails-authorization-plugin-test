== Authorization Test Application

This is a test application (and new application scaffold) for the Authorization
plugin with Object Roles table support. The Authorization plugin is described
in vendors/plugins/Authorization/README (or check nicely formatted HTML docs in
that plugin directory /doc).

How to start:

1. Create a database
2. Make sure /config/database.yml has the correct settings to connect to your DB.
3. Run the migration using "rake migrate"
4. Start webrick with "script/server"
5. Surf to http://localhost:3000

Things to look at:

* The integration tests in /test/integration. Enter "rake test:integration" to run them.
* The migration scripts in /db/migrate.
* Notice how you can mix hardwired roles in your code with database roles.
